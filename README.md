_**This is my Fork of [grbl](https://github.com/grbl/grbl). 
It is based on the eddge branche and uses [L6474 Stepper-drivers from ST](http://www.st.com/web/catalog/sense_power/FM142/CL851/SC1794/SS1498/LN1724/PF252762).
I am using 4 [X-NUCLEO-IHM01A1](http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/tools/PF260715) boards and a custem board with a Atmega1284p controller.**_
